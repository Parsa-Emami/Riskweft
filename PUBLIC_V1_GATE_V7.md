# RiskWeft — Public v1 Gate v7

Stable v1 is permitted only when:
- all state/invariant/authorization tests pass
- first slice and core engine E2E are reproducible from clean clone
- fuzz/failure suite has no unresolved critical finding
- p95/p99 and saturation behavior are published with workload/hardware metadata
- restore/rebuild and N-1 upgrade rehearsal pass
- OpenAPI/event/plugin compatibility suite passes
- WCAG 2.2 AA target is met for core UI workflows
- OSPS/SSDF/ASVS evidence matrix has no unexplained applicable gap
- REUSE/license/dependency review passes
- release SBOM/provenance/signatures verify
- public demo uses synthetic/safe data and respects the project's dual-use/privacy boundary
